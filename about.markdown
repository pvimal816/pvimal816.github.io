Hello and welcome! My name is Vimal, and I am a software engineer with an MTech in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc).

Currently, I am working at [Polymage Labs](https://www.polymagelabs.com), an innovative ML compiler startup located at IISc SID. My primary responsibility involves identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks in the compiler-generated code, as well as implementing optimization techniques in the MLIR-based compiler to accelerate the workloads.

At Polymage Labs, I work alongside a talented team of professionals who share my passion for technology and innovation. Together, we are developing cutting-edge solutions to tackle some of the most challenging problems in the field of machine learning.

If you would like to learn more about my work or have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. I would be more than happy to chat with you!
